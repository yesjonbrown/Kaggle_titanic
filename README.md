Kaggle_titanic
==============
I'm using this data set from the Kaggle competition to work on my pandas, numpy, and matplotlib skills. Hopefully you can understand my code, I've tried to insert comments throughout to help in terms of readability. Any suggestions on improvements or changes would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Jon
