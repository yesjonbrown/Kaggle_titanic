Kaggle_submissions
==================
This is my first Kaggle submission and is a way for me to try and work on expanding my data analysis and programming skills. The only submission I have right now is the Bioresponse data set, seen here https://www.kaggle.com/c/bioresponse. As I work on more data sets, I will work on making different folders for my different projects. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I'm still fairly new to the world of data science.

Cheers!
Jon
