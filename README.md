Kaggle_titanic
==============
I'm using this data set from the Kaggle competition to work on my pandas, numpy, and matplotlib skills. The original Kaggle post is here, https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted. Hopefully you can understand my code, I've tried to insert comments throughout to help in terms of readability. Any suggestions on improvements or changes would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Jon
